                WASHINGTON – The coronavirus pandemic laid bare the deep fissures within the care industry, a strained sector 
                that disproportionately relies on millions of women of color who are paid little to look after children, disabled 
                people and the country's growing population of older Americans.

            <p>
            The longstanding challenges spiraled into a public crisis last year as COVID-19 shuttered thousands of schools and day care centers 
            and forced parents, some who could no longer afford child care, to leave their jobs and shoulder the burden at home. Care workers – 
            <a href="x">among the lowest paid in the country</a>
             – were sidelined as day care centers were forced to cut costs, while other workers left for 
            higher paying jobs.

                But those circumstances could change for millions of families and care workers as Democrats hash out the details of a sweeping $3.5 
                trillion social spending package. The 
                <a href="x">centerpiece of President Joe Biden's</a>
                 agenda would expand access to quality child-care programs 
                and home or community-based care for seniors, provide free preschool, and improve wages and benefits for caregivers.

                While the size and scope of the package is 
                <a href="x">still being debated by Congress</a>
                , experts say even a trimmed down social spending plan 
                would mark one of the largest ever federal investments in the care sector, a sea change in a largely undervalued and often invisible 
                part of the U.S. economy that could shift the fortunes for millions of American families.

                "It is a historic change in the way that we care for people in our country," said Lisa Guide, co-founder of Women Effect Action 
                Fund, a group that advocates for economic gender equality and women’s rights. "We're placing our money where our values are if we

                according to a report published in January by ReadyNation, a nonprofit advocacy group of business executives. Child care providers are facing

                Democrats are aiming to spend around $450 billion on child care in the 
                social infrastructure package, including raising wages for child-care 
                workers, reducing the cost of child care for low- and middle-income 
                families through federal subsidies, and providing universal pre-kindergarten

                Democrats are also seeking to extend until 2025 the expansion of the Child 
                and Dependent Care Tax Credit, which allows taxpayers to deduct expenses 
                incurred for child care – a move advocates say could be a key step in making 
                the credit permanent.

                The president has also called for spending $400 billion on home- and

                in their homes rather than move into assisted living facilities. It would

                    In the last two years, the three biggest U.S. cities and Rhode Island and Arizona have passed laws that let workers use 
                    paid sick days to care for anyone who's like family to them.

                The administration has also asked for $225 billion over 10 years to create a federal paid family leave system, giving Americans 
                up to 12 weeks to care for a new child or family member or to recover from a serious medical condition. Workers would also be

                Abbey Conley of Henrico County, Virginia, never intended to stop working after she gave birth to her first child in 2017. The 
                small, nonprofit veterinary clinic where she was employed didn't have a maternity leave policy and with so few employees, it 
                was not required to provide unpaid leave for new parents.

                Conley was eventually granted 12 weeks of unpaid leave but a doctor recommended she stop working a month before her due date 
                over concerns about high blood pressure. Her husband had merely a few days at home after she delivered. Conley returned to work 
                after two months at home with her newborn, a struggle that left her falling asleep at the wheel while driving.

                leaving the workforce altogether in 2020 after losing child care during the pandemic. The couple constantly worried about finances 
                and the experience has led them to decide not to have another child. She also has no plans to return to the workforce.

                 Earlier this month, a Treasury Department report detailed an "unworkable" child care system that hinders parents' ability to 
            contribute to the U.S. economy. Years of underinvestment led to an unaffordable system that doesn't accommodate all who need it 
            and where workers are grossly underpaid, according to the report.

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                “Child care is a textbook example of a broken market, and one reason is that when you pay for it, the price does not account 
                for all the positive things it confers on our society," Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement following the 
                report's release.

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                An average family spends about 13% of household income to pay for child care for young children, the report found. Meanwhile, 
                fewer than 20% of children who are eligible for the Child Care Development Fund, one of the largest federal assistance programs 
                for low-income families, actually receive the funding.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Most of the time, the subsidy isn't generous enough to cover the full cost, leaving families who can't afford child care to make 
                up the difference, according to Rasheed Malik, associate director of research for Early Childhood Policy at the Center for American 
                Progress.

            <p>
                The House legislative proposal – which is still fluid – would cap parents' contribution to child care at 7% of their annual income. 
                A family making below 75% of their state's median income – which hovers between $50,000 and $80,000 in most states – would receive 
                free child care.

                A typical family would save more than $100 per week in 32 states under the proposal, according to Malik. For families who struggle with the cost but need child care in order 
                to pay their bills, that has a "huge impact on the status of their checking account and in their overall annual take home pay," he added.

                The bill also would address the dearth of child care providers across the country, including in more rural settings or in non-
                native English-speaking communities. States would need to develop a plan to increase supply of not only existing programs but 
                also services that focus on priorities like people with disabilities.

                Mario Cardona, chief of policy and practice at Child Care Aware of America, also points to economic reverberations later in life.

                their 401(k) plan or other mechanisms that exist to support retirement.

                An average woman with two children could see an increase in lifetime earning of $97,000 with access to affordable child care, 
                <a href="x">according a report from Columbia University and the National Women's Law Center</a>
                 released earlier this year. About 1.3 million women 
                in the U.S. could see a collective $130 billion boost in incomes over their lifetimes.

                "By not providing affordable, accessible high-quality child care for folks to take advantage of, it hurts decades later when they're 
                looking at retirement because they weren't able to save as much as they could have potentially by being engaged in the labor force," 
                he said.

                A federal paid family leave policy would help Americans who were made jobless by the pandemic get back to work, according to a 
                <a href="x">survey released earlier this month</a>
                 by the Bipartisan Policy Center and Morning Consult. The survey found 37% of Americans said 
                they could go back into the workforce if their employer offered paid family leave - including 45% of unemployed caregivers.

            Nearly 80% of workers said they do not have access to paid family leave while 60% do not have access to paid medical leave, according

                As for home care, advocates point out the initiative would save federal dollars in the long term. The annual cost to keep an individual 
                in assisted living is 
                <a href="x">estimated to be $90,000 compared to $26,000</a>
                 to keep them in home care, according to Mia Ives-Rublee, director of 
                the Disability Justice Initiative at the Center for American Progress.

                The federal cash injection could also help relieve the backlog of people waiting for home and community-based services as states only 
                offer a certain amount of slots due to funding constraints, according to Ives-Rublee. About 820,000 Americans are on waitlists for Home 
                and Community Based Services program.

                Even as parents return to work, day centers are still struggling to keep doors open. A July survey found that 4 out of 5 child 
                care centers are grappling with staffing shortages, according to

                Congress in March approved $39 billion in COVID-19 relief funds to help child care providers pay their rent and rehire workers 
                made jobless by the pandemic, as well as make child care more accessible and affordable for low-income families. But the relief 
                program, which White House officials acknowledged was a starting point, has already stalled as only 18 states have so far made 
                applications available for child care centers to get the funding,

                    trillion coronavirus relief package. "The additional money does help alleviate the pressure," said Walker, 29, who took custody 
                    of her two siblings last year after her mother overdosed. The $800 credit will help make up for losses she incurred after quitting

                A federalized policy approach would incentivize states to guarantee certain levels of quality and equitability, Malik said. 
                The bill also would require states to set up a system to ensure a living wage for early educators, who on average make $12.50 an hour. 
                The policy aims to create a "wage ladder" and better training to encourage professionals to stay in the field.

                While the federal cash infusion would fortify the industry and help providers rehire workers who were made jobless or forced to 
                quit during the pandemic, it's also estimated to create 1.1 million jobs in health care, child care and elder care services, 
                according to an

                , cited by Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., said the federal investment would not only raise wages for caregivers but create

                The plan could offset costs in other social safety net programs, too, according to Ives-Rublee. An estimated 53% of home care 
                workers receive some form of public assistance, including 27% who rely on food and nutrition assistance and 32% who are covered 
                by Medicaid insurance,

                "A lot of these individuals have to work second jobs just to make ends meet and that's just unfair because they're working long 
                hours and often are on call during the night time," Ives-Rublee said. "It's not just the personal care assistance but it's also 
                vocational training, transportation and a wide variety of things that help keep individuals within a community setting."
